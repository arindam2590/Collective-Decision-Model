# Collective Decision Model (Majority / Voter / Kuramoto)

A lightweight swarm simulation to study **collective decision making** and **coordination** under three canonical models:

- **Majority Rule**
- **Voter**
- **Kuramoto** (phase-based synchronization)

The simulator runs in **pygame**, logs perâ€“consensus-checkpoint metrics to CSV, and renders comparison plots across agent sizes and target counts. A batch mode sweeps common configurations and writes all results under `Data/`.
